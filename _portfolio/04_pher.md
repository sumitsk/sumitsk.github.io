* Proposed Prioritized Hindsight Experience Replay for sample efficient reinforcement learning in multi-goal manipulation environments from rewards which are sparse and binary.
* The agent assigns priorities to transitions stored in replay memory based on their temporal difference errors and performs importance sampling of the stored transitions for training its policy network.
