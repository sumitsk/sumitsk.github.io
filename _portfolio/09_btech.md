* The project was carried out in collaboration with a regional hospital and aimed at reducing the required number of surgeons during throat surgeries in rural areas.
* Designed a throat retractor which can hold tissues and flesh at the site of incision. 
* Ensured wide area coverage and easy assembling of the system with the help of custom designed lever-operated cam locks.
