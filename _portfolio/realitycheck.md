* Built a feature-based classifier for distinguishing real photographic images from computer generated ones.
* Trained 8 classifiers and combined them to build a meta-classifier which achieved accuracy of 88% and AUC of 0.923 compared to the accuracy of 86% and AUC of 0.896 as attained by the best classifier on the same validation set.
