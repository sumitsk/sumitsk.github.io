I am a final year Masters of Science in Robotics student at the <a href="http://ri.cmu.edu">Robotics Institute</a>, Carnegie Mellon University advised by Prof. Katia Sycara and Prof. George Kantor. My research interests span Spatiotemporal modelling and prediction with Bayesian Neural Networks, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Graph Neural Networks, and Active Learning with Gaussian Processes. Prior to coming to CMU, I completed my undergraduate studies from <a href="https://iitk.ac.in/"> IIT Kanpur</a>, India and twice received Academic Excellence Award. I am also a recepient of the prestigious <a href="https://www.iusstf.org/program/sn-bose-scholars-program">S.N. Bose Scholarship </a> under which I carried out a summer internship at <a href="https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/">Personal Robotics Lab</a>, CMU headed by <a href="https://goodrobot.ai/">Prof. Siddhartha Srinivasa</a>.
